dji_m100_gazebo
=========

A ROS package for simulating the DJI Matrice 100 Drone in Gazebo. Initial work is made in [here](https://github.com/caochao39/hku_m100_gazebo). On top of that I have added a Gazebo plugin compatible with ROS Melodic. 

**Installation**

Clone this repo into your catkin workspace and build.


**Configuration**
  * Turn on DJI Matrice 100 and connect it to the PC simulator


**Usage**

Execute the one-liner.
> $ roslaunch dji_m100_gazebo simulate.launch
